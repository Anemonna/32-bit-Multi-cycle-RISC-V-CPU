# 32-bit-Multi-cycle-RISC-V-CPU
This repository includes the complete design of a 32-bit multi-cycle CPU, CDC-6624, based on RISC-V. The CPU is designed using a finite state machine. This project is a course assignment for the challenging digital circuit course in the third year of the Microelectronics Science and Engineering program at Glasgow College, UESTC.
